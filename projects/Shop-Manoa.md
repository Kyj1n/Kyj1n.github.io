The project, tentatively named “Shop-Manoa”, aims to address the rapid turnover of goods and services among students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM). The primary goal is to create an effective marketplace for campus-specific items, facilitating their recycling and reuse in a safe manner.

Shop-Manoa allows UHM students, faculty, and staff to buy and sell student-related goods and services. Whether it'd range from furniture, to transporation, to food, the range of items being bought and sold out site are wide. Thus, this platform is similar and inspired by Craigslist, with some key differences to help fight anonymity, and the allows the users freedom to decide how to contact and how transactions can be done.

In this project, my main contribution was morely towards the development of the Profile, some-what of the landing page, and a lot of effort towards the list of items page. 

In my opinion, the biggest obstacle for me was soley the list of items page (labeled as "Items"), as the site sole relied on that one page. Having most of our pages requiring and linking to it alone. Not only that but it was also the most important page on the website. Otherwise. How can we have a buy-and-sell website without a page to show what can be bought?

From this experience, I have a learned a valuable lesson of building a function web application using various software engineering tools such as meteor, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, and React. 

Additionally, as this was my first group project. It has truly shows me both the benefits and obstacles that come when a group of people come together to accomplish a task through the world of web development. Whether that be how much easier it is to accomplish tasks by not having to do everything yourself. And to much more difficult problems like merge conflicts and deciding as a team. In the end, this was an experience that really opened my eye to what actual software engineering truly is through collaboration and hard work.

In conclusion, this project has been a difficult but exciting journey for me. Through the help of my teammates, and my own contribution, we were able to accomplish a task that required all of our hard work. Though it may not be as cool as those hacking scenes that you see in the movies. Nor did we develop a world-changing site. At the end of the day, we still fulfilled a feat that we can only say is the beginning of all our journeys.
