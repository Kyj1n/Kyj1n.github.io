Though this project of mine may quite be far in the past. It is still one of importance to me as it was when I first was introduced to my world of interest
in STEM. During the 5th grade, I decided to join my school's robotics team. At such a young age, the type of robots we tinkered with were quite simple. They were brushbots. Brush bots are small, simple robots created by attaching a vibrating motor to the bristles of a toothbrush. The vibrations cause the brush bot to move and skitter around on a flat surface, offering a fun and accessible way to explore basic principles of robotics and engineering through a DIY (do-it-yourself) project.

Later in the school year, elementary schools around the island with robotics clubs all participated in a tournament that was held at the state capitol building. For my group, we participated in the sumo fight contest. This activity involved us students customizing and adding props to our small teeny tiny bots in hopes of making it heavy and "fighting" other brush bots by pushing them out of a drawn circle. In the end, I did not end up winning. However, it is a memory I can always cherish in my heart. An experience I will never forget.

The beginning of my STEM journey.
