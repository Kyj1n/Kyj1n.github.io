"Galactoid" is one of the games that I created on Scratch as a final project in a simple computer science back in High School. There a few other projects that I've created at the time but I decided this is the one that I wanted to showcase because it was one that took me some time. 
The game is a simple spaceship arcade style shooter in which your goal is to simply eliminate as much alien ships while trying not to get exploded yourself. 

Though scratch is a "coding" style that is very simple. One that doesn't even require you to even write lines but instead connect together puzzle like pieces of code. I consider this project of mines one of importance as it is indeed one that helped me spark my interest in computer science bringing me to where I am today.
