"Galactoid" is one of the games that I created on Scratch as a final project in a simple computer science back in High School. There a few other projects that I've created at the time but I decided this is the one that I wanted to showcase because it was one that took me some time. 
The game is a simple spaceship arcade style shooter in which your goal is to simply eliminate as much alien ships while trying not to get exploded yourself. 

There are other similar SCRATCH programs under my account "Kyj1n". And can be found when searched up. Feel free to check it out. Though they may be amatuerish and nothing to level or complexitiy of what we university students do, but I hope it interests you and shows you that coding doesn't have to be complex. It can be learned by anyone. Thanks to the help of programs such as SCRATCH which simplfies the tough concepts of coding and shows you that even through "simple" work you can make a big impact.

Though scratch is a "coding" style that is very simple. One that doesn't even require you to even write lines but instead connect together puzzle like pieces of code. I consider this project of mines one of importance as it is indeed one that helped me spark my interest in computer science bringing me to where I am today.
