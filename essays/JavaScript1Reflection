<h2> Entering the world of JavaScript </h2>
Honestly, I wouldn't say I'm the best programmer but Javascript is not as bad as I thought it would be. Starting by learning Python and moving on to Java was quite a jump for me.
The style of coding was a completely different world to me. At first, it seemed ok but as the semester passed, the syntax and overall difficulty of the language got to me. One example that made me dislike Java is the fact that it requires you to be very specific with your actions, even much more than compared to when coding in Python.

So when I read the syllabus and learned that we were learning Javascript, I was honestly expecting to go down that rabbit hole of stress once again.
