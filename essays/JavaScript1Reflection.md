*Entering the world of JavaScript*

## My Experience with coding

Honestly, I wouldn't say I'm the best programmer but Javascript is not as bad as I thought it would be. Starting by learning Python and moving on to Java was quite a jump for me.
The style of coding was a completely different world to me. At first, it seemed ok but as the semester passed, the syntax and overall difficulty of the language got to me. Java to me was just unnecessarily complicated. One example that made me dislike Java is the fact that it requires you to be very specific with your actions, even much more than compared to when coding in Python.
So when I read the syllabus and learned that we were learning Javascript, I was honestly expecting to go down that rabbit hole of stress once again. However, it did not turn out that way. As I gradually went through the freecodecamp course, it brought me a familiarity that reminded me of Python. Yes, of course, they’re not the same, but that feeling of not being too restricted by rules and syntax brought me relief. Creating methods/functions was a lot easier, variable creation was very easy, not having to worry about data types, and overall much more straightforward. 


## Is Javascript great?

So when asked the question “Do you think Javascript is a good or bad programming language from a software engineering perspective?”. 
I say yes. Yes, it is. From what I have seen so far, and in my opinion, I feel like Java script is a versatile language. Which will prove very useful in the world of software development.

## Athletic Software Engineering 

My experience so far athletic software engineering has been particularly new. This way of learning emphasizes a lot of practice and repetition which will only ensure skill improvement. The WODs especially will provide a great way to master JavaScript. 
However, I do have concerns and fear that this would only lead to a heavy workload. Though overall this constant learning style will not only help my understanding of JavaScript but also make the learning process much more faster and will surely “stain it into my brain”.

## Overall

In conclusion, Javascript seems to be a great language. I know it is quite too early to say that, as I am only a beginner in this new world but there has to be a reason why Javascript is the most popular language in 2023. And I am excited and interested to find out why.
