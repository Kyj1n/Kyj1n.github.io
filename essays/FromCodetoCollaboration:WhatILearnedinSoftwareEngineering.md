*From Code to Collaboration: What I Learned in Software Engineering. The Second Time.*

Throughout this course, I established three SMART goals to achieve personal development: software engineering concept renewal and acquisition of new skills, enhanced time management abilities, better communication, and teamwork competencies. Each of my defined targets showed noticeable improvement throughout the course.

I established my initial goal to update my software engineering knowledge and gain a new understanding. I achieved this goal by using tools like React and Bootstrap, and databases. Which I was familiar with, though it still helped me expand my existing knowledge base. I discovered two new technologies: Visual Studio and TypeScript. The learning curve proved challenging, but Im confident to say that I have achieved progress.

My second goal was to enhance my time management capabilities. I maintained a structured schedule to prevent working at the last minute. I fulfilled deadlines and maintained equilibrium between my class work and other duties. Team-based work sometimes led to excessive procrastination. I myself am guilty. Which resulted in occasional "little-work" heavy periods. Though I did end up finishing all assignments on time, I was responsible for the team and discovered the value of teamwork habits, and that getting things done on time is essential.

My third goal focused on enhancing my skills in collaborative work. Teamwork started on day one of this class and provided me with a new learning experience compared to previous courses. Especially with the fact that teamwork was something essential straight from day one of this class. The experience taught me to enhance my communication skills and share work tasks equally, and adapt when plans fail. Our team experienced some challenges, but we developed into a stronger unit, which led us to discover our most effective approach. The experience taught me valuable teamwork and communication skills that I will bring into my professional future.

Overall, this course provided me with valuable growth opportunities while I developed new skills and knowledge that I am proud to have acquired.
